A cellular automaton is a modeling tool that can be used in the 
classroom with either pencil and paper or on computers. Cellular automata 
can be important in motivating students, reaching students with certain 
learning styles, helping students develop modeling skills, and in the 
development of curricula for teaching certain computer technologies.
</p><p>
</p><h2>I. What are Cellular Automata?</h2>

A cellular automaton is a model that can be used to show how the 
elements of a system interact with each other. Each element of the system 
is assigned a cell. The cells can be 2-dimensional squares, 3-dimensional 
blocks or another shape such as a hexagon. The cells are arranged in a 
configuration. Cells joined together to form a single line make up a 
one-dimensional cellular automaton. Cells arranged on a grid form a 
two-dimensional cellular automaton. Blocks placed in three-dimensional 
space create a three-dimensional cellular automaton.

Each cell has a defined neighborhood. For example, in a 
one dimension cellular automaton, a neighborhood of radius one for
a given cell would include the cell to the immediate right and the
cell to the immediate left. The cell itself may or may not be included
in the neighborhood. The cells on the end may (or may not) be treated as
"touching" each other as if the line of cells were circular. For two 
dimensional cellular automata, the neighborhood might be the north,
east, south, and west neighbors. Another possibility would be the
north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and
northwest neighbors. Also, the neighborhood could be "directional." 
For example, the neighborhood might be the northeast, east and 
southeast neighbors. The cells on the top and bottom and on the right
edge and left edge may (or may not) be treated as "touching"
each other to form a donut or torus shape.

Each cell is given a possible range of values. In the initial
configuration of the cellular automata, each cell is assigned a "starting"
value from the range of possible values. For example, if the range of
possible values is 0 or 1, then each cell would be assigned a 0 or a
1 in the initial configuration. If the range of cells were any number
from say 30 to 80, the range would be divided into segments and each
segment assigned a value. For example, 30 to 31.5 might be assigned a 0
( written (30,31.5)-&gt;0 ), 31.5 to 33 might be assigned a 1 
( written (31.5,33)-&gt;1 ), and so forth. (Another name for assigning
ranges of values to integers is mapping as in the range 30 to 31.5 is
mapped to 0.) The reason it is important to use integer numbers in the 
range of values is so that the cellular automaton can be visualized over 
time. Each integer value represents a color to the computer. The color 
an integer represents can be changed by changing the palette.

With each cell is associated a transition function and a transition
rule. Taken together, the transition rule and function take as input the
present states (i.e., the present values)  of all of the cells in a given 
cell's neighborhood and generate the next state (i.e., the next value) of 
the given cell. When applied to all of the cells individually in a cellular 
automaton, the next state of the whole cellular automaton is generated from 
the present state. Then the next state of the cellular automata is copied 
to the (new) present state and the process is repeated for as many clock 
cycles as desired. The most widely used transition function is to add up the 
values of all of the cells in the defined neighborhood. The choice of a 
transition rule depends on the phenomena being modeled (See Examples A
through H below). The transition function could be a differential equation
taken from physics (note that cellular automata are a modeler's counterpart
to a physicist's concept of a field [3]). Calculus is not needed to
approximate the effect of a differential equation on a given 
environment being modeled[4]. Students can be shown how to find the next
state of a cellular automaton (which uses a differential equation as a 
transition function) by performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division. Finally, the environment being modeled may dictate that 
some group(s) of cells are given a different transition function from 
other group(s) of cells (See Example E below).

<h2>II. Why use cellular automata in the classroom?</h2>

Cellular automata can be used creatively to address problems
in the areas of motivation, learning styles, development of modeling 
skills, and the teaching of technology. Each of the four areas is an 
important consideration in the decision of the best use of classroom time.

Some computer games are based on the notion of cellular automata
and students find them engaging and fascinating. The same concepts
that are used in constructing cellular automata games can be used
to model mathematical, scientific, and sociological phenomena. Proper
use of the fascination can be employed to motivate students' interests
in studying important problems and working out solutions. This could lead to
students deciding on a career goal rather than dropping out of school.

Students' learning styles are an important consideration in
teaching any subject. One learning style is that of visualization.
Some students are primarily visual learners and some are secondarily
visual learners. If a student is primarily a visual learner, then
visualization is critical to the student's performance. If a student,
is secondarily a visual learner, then visualization reinforces
concepts taught by other means. Cellular automata are a natural way
to visualize phenomena because each possible value of a cell is
assigned a color. The color can be added to a piece of paper using
crayons or visualized on a computer screen. Since the values in the
cells repeatedly change from the present state to the next state, the 
visualization changes over time (See Examples A through H below).

Students need to know modeling skills because all of the
sciences are using computer models for experimentation. For example,
drug companies are using molecular models to develop new drugs.
Another example is the use of computer models by automobile manufacturers
to test the durability of the design of a new car during a crash.
Also, airplanes are designed with computer models. The use of computer
models to perform scientific experiments has lead to the teaching of 
modeling skills to students as a new way of advancing scientific research. 
Cellular automata are a natural way to teach modeling skills because
they incorporate time and space (the world in which we live). 
The implication of the question "How can we expect students to learn
trigonometry in the twelfth grade if we do not teach students how
to count in the first grade?" leads to the inquiry "How can we expect
students to develop realistic models in the twelfth grade if we
do not teach the concept of a cell in the first grade?"

Teaching cellular automata gives students a "common sense" about
computers and instills a confidence in attacking problems using
a computer. This is true because of the close relationship between
cellular automata and computers. Both have cells that contain values
and both use a present state--next state mode of processing. The clock
cycle of a computer (e.g., a 66 megaherz clock cycle machine) is the
time it takes for a computer to go from a present state to a next state.
In fact computers have been designed using cellular automata by
various scientists including Von Neumann, Codd, and Banks[3]. The design
of one of the world's fastest massively parallel processing machines,
the Connection Machine, is based on the concept of cellular automata[1].
Cellular automata force students to think creatively rather that
allowing a computer to treat them like a vegetable and give them
the notion that they do not need to learn to think because the computer
will do all of their thinking for them.

<h2>III. Examples</h2>

All of the examples following can be worked out by hand or on a
computer. Source code is available for all of the examples.  The source 
code is written in Microsoft's FORTRAN PowerStation, Version 1.0. Each 
example is given a title, a discipline to which it relates, a source from 
which the example or the motivation for the example was taken, and a 
recommended grade level--middle school or high school. (Some of the 
concepts recommended for middle school--or even high school--could be 
simplified and taught at even lower levels). The examples should
not be regarded as finished projects but as models of techniques from
which to chose. For example, if a student were planning to model a system
governed by differential equations, she or he should study example F.
Each example is followed by suggested exercises.
<pre>A. Title: Lights on an Electrical Circuit
   Discipline: Electrical Engineering
   Source: Fractint Version 18.2 for DOS
   Grade Level: Middle School

Consider a one-dimensional cellular automaton consisting 
of a single row of eight cells in which the cell to the far left is 
considered to "touch" the cell to the far right. Each cell can contain a 
1 or a 0. A 1 represents a light that is on and a 0 represents a light 
that is off. A possible initial configuration is
	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
A neighborhood of radius one includes the cell to the immediate left,
the cell to immediate right and (optionally) the cell itself. The
transition function is to add each group of three adjoining cells.
If all three adjoining cells each contain a 0, the result of the summation
is 0 (the smallest possible result). If all three adjoining cells
each contain a 1, the result of the summation is 3 (the largest possible
result). The transition rule maps the possible results of the summation
to the possible values a cell can contain. One possible mapping is
( 0-&gt;1, 1-&gt;0, 2-&gt;1, 3-&gt;0). Based upon the facts given above, the cellular
automaton will continuously cycle between four states as in

1st State:              0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0  --&gt;
2nd State:              1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1     |
3rd State:              0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0     |
4th State:              0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0     |
5th State:              0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0  ---
etc.

The calculations for the transition from the 1st State to the 2nd State
are:

Step 1: Rewrite the present state
			0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 
			
Step 2: Compute the sum for each cell
			0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0

Step 3: Apply the rule ( 0-&gt;1, 1-&gt;0, 2-&gt;1, 3-&gt;0)
			1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1

The examples in Fractint Version 18.2 are given by number of states,
the radius of the neighborhood and a transition rule. The initial 
configuration is assumed to be surrounded by 0's to the right and the left.

Exercise A1: Have the students change the initial configuration. What is
the new cycle of lights.

Exercise A2: Suppose the ends do not "touch." How is the cycle of lights
affected?

Exercise A3: Increase the number of cells to 16 in a row with the ends
"touching." What is the new cycle of lights for a given configuration.

Exercise A4: Change the rule from ( 0-&gt;1, 1-&gt;0, 2-&gt;1, 3-&gt;0) to
( 0-&gt;0, 1-&gt;1, 2-&gt;0, 3-&gt;1). How does the rule change affect the cycle of 
lights?

B. Title: Genetic Drift
   Discipline: Biology
   Source: Cellular Automata Machines: A New Environment for Modeling
   Grade Level: High School

Example B shows changes in traits of a population over time. 
For example, a person may have trait X only, trait Y only, both or neither.
Two planes of 256 rows by 256 columns of cells are used if running the 
program on a 486 DX2 or faster processor. (If done by hand or on a slower 
computer the number of rows and columns should be scaled down to 16 rows 
by 16 columns.) The rows and the columns are numbered from 0 to 255 
starting with the upper left hand corner as in
</p><pre>	  0 1 2 ... 255
	0
	1
	2
	:
      255

The initial configuration is for one plane to contain a circle to 
the left of center and one plane to contain a circle to the right of center.
The cells forming the circles contain ones and the background zero's. Four 
colors are used: a zero in a cell of both planes is black, a one in a cell
of the first plane and a zero in the corresponding cell of the second plane
is green, a zero and a one is blue, and two ones are red. The transition
rule is to check to see if a cell contains a zero. If it does, then continue
checking the other cells. However, if the cell contains a one, it "drifts."
A north, south, east, or west direction is chosen at random. The cell is
set to zero and the cell in the chosen direction is set to 1. This process
is repeated for each of the cells in both planes.

Exercise B1: Modify the program to start with overlapping diamond shapes
rather than overlapping circles. How does the simulation change over time?

Exercise B2:  Modify the program so that it is a model for diffusion rather 
than genetic drift. This can be done by checking to see if a cell in the
chosen direction of movement is occupied (i.e., contains a 1).  If the 
adjoining cell is occupied, the move is voided.

C. Title: Simulated Annealing
   Discipline: Thermodynamics
   Source: Cellular Automata Machines: A New Environment for Modeling
   Grade Level: High School

Example C shows how areas of a substance are consolidated by slowing
the annealing process. One plane of 256 rows by 256 columns of cells is 
used if running the program on a 486 DX2 or faster processor. (If done 
by hand or on a slower computer the number of rows and columns should be
scaled down to 16 rows by 16 columns.) The rows and the columns are numbered
from 0 to 255 starting with the upper left hand corner as in

	  0 1 2 ... 255
	0
	1
	2
	:
      255

The initial configuration is to randomly put ones in 50% of the
cells.  Each cell has eight neighbors. If the total sum of the ones
in the eight neighbors and the cell itself is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 5, then the
next state of the cell is a zero; otherwise, the next state of the cell is
a one. This process is repeated for each of the cells in the plane.

Exercise C1: Change the % of 1's in the initial configuration to 30%.
How is the simulation affected?

Exercise C2: Change the rule to a strict voting rule (a nucleation/
percolation model). How does the visualization differ?

D. Title: Soil Erosion
   Discipline: Environmental Studies
   Source: Cellular Automata Machines: A New Environment for Modeling
   Grade Level: Middle School

Example D shows how barren spots develop as a result of the
erosion of soil. One plane of 256 rows by 256 columns of cells
is used if running the program on a 486 DX2 or faster processor. (If done 
by hand or on a slower computer the number of rows and columns should be
scaled down to 16 rows by 16 columns.) The rows and the columns are numbered
from 0 to 255 starting with the upper left hand corner as in

	  0 1 2 ... 255
	0
	1
	2
	:
      255

The initial configuration is to randomly put ones in 48% of the
cells.  Each cell has four sets of neighbors which are grouped by sides. 
The sets are {NW, N, NE}, {NE, E, SE}, {SE, S, SW}, and {SW, W, NW}.
If a cell contain a piece of soil, represented by a one, the piece of
soil is "blown away" (i.e., the cell is set to zero) if any of the  
four sets of neighbors contain three zeros. Otherwise, the piece of
soil remains. This process is repeated for each of the cells in the plane.

Exercise D1: Show the students the following diagrams. In which of the
diagrams is a particle of soil in the center blown away?

	1 0 1           1 1 0           0 1 1            
	0 1 0           0 1 0           1 1 1
	0 1 0           1 1 0           0 0 0

Exercise D2: Change the rule so that the corners are considered rather
than the sides. How does this change the results of the picture?

E. Title: A Circular Wave Produced by a Localized Disturbance
   Discipline: Fluid Dynamics
   Source: Cellular Automata Machines: A New Environment for Modeling
   Grade Level: High School
	
Example E shows a circular wave propagating outward due to a
localized disturbance. One plane of 256 rows by 256 columns of cells
is used if running the program on a 486 DX2 or faster processor. (If done 
by hand or on a slower computer the number of rows and columns should be
scaled down to 16 rows by 16 columns.) The rows and the columns are numbered
from 0 to 255 starting with the upper left hand corner as in

	  0 1 2 ... 255
	0
	1
	2
	:
      255

The initial configuration is to randomly put ones in 50% of the
cells.  An 16 by 16 square of ones in the center is the localized
disturbance. The Margolus neighborhood is used which means that a cell's
neighborhood changes between even and odd states. For state one, the grid
of cells is partitioned into squares of four cells each. The sides of the
grid are considered to touch each other. In state two, each cell is grouped
with three different cells in the opposite direction. For example, if
a cell was the northeast cell in a group of four, in now becomes the
southwest cell in a group of four. The cells do not move but the grouping
does change. The transition rules are for each cell to swap with its 
diagonal neighbor in the group of four. The only exception is for
collisions with two ones on opposite diagonals and two zeros on the other
two diagonals. In this case the ones and zeros trade places. For example,
instead of

	0  1  -&gt;  0  1        
	1  0  -&gt;  1  0                       

the transition is
	
	0  1  -&gt;  1  0
	1  0  -&gt;  0  1

The process is repeated for each group of cells.
					     
Exercise E1: Create two localized disturbances. How is the simulation 
affected?

Exercise E2: Modify a collision resolution state from 

1  1  -&gt;  0  1   to   1  1  -&gt;  1  1  
1  0  -&gt;  1  1        1  0  -&gt;  0  1

How is the visualization affected?

F. Title: The Cooling of a Hot Pie in a Refrigerator
   Discipline: Differential Equations Applied to Physics
   Source: Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations
   Grade Level: High School

Example F concerns a specific application involving the
refrigeration of food.  Specifically, what might be the affect of
taking a hot food item out of the oven and placing it beside
an item subject to spoilage? The items chosen are a freshly 
baked pie for the hot food item and a bottle of milk for the item
subject to spoilage. Other factors that are considered in the
problem are as follows:

	(1) the temperature of the pie; 
	(2) the temperature of the refrigerator; 
	(3) the size of the pie;
	(4) the size of the refrigerator;
	(5) the size of the cooling unit in the refrigerator; 
	(6) the distance of the pie from the bottle of milk; and 
	(7) the rates at which the various items achieve an equilibrium
	    temperature.

The results are presented visually. A "bird's eye" view
of the refrigerator shows a two dimensional scene. The area of view  
encompasses 256 by 256 cells. Outlines of the refrigerator, cooling unit, 
pie and bottle of milk are superimposed on top of the area of view.
The inside of the refrigerator changes colors based on temperature.
Blue represents the coldest temperature and red represents the
hottest temperature. Temperatures in between are represented by various
shades in between blue and red.

Newton's law of cooling is used for each cell individually
to bring the refrigerator to equilibrium[2]. The law is represented as

	dx = k * ( x - a ) dt

where:

	(1) x is the current temperature of a given cell (each of the 
	    256 * 256 = 65,536 cells has its own x value);
	(2) dx is the change in temperature of a given cell;
	(3) t is the time;
	(4) dt is the change in time;
	(5) k is a constant of proportionality; and
	(6) a is the average temperature of the North, East, South, and
	    West neighbors of a cell.

The initial values chosen for the simulation are:
 
	(1) 40 degrees is the initial temperature of the refrigerator 
	    (and also the constant temperature of the cooling unit);
	(2) 200 degrees is the initial temperature of the pie;
	(3) -.95 is the arbitrarily chosen constant of proportionality 
	    for air in the refrigerator;
	(4) -.25 is the arbitrarily chosen constant of proportionality 
	    for a bottle of milk;
	(5) -.15 is the arbitrarily chosen constant of proportionality 
	    for the pie;
	(6) the dimensions of the cooling unit are 50 rows by 20 columns;
	(7) the location of the cooling unit is the upper left hand corner
	    or the refrigerator;
	(8) the diameter of the bottle of milk is 30 cells;
	(9) the location of the center of the bottle of milk is
	    at row 130 and column 110;
	(10) the diameter of pie is 80 cells; and
	(11) the location of the center of the pie is
	     at row 130 and column 190; and
	(12) 1 is dt (the change in time).

The transition rule is to apply the differential equation to each cell.
Of particular interest are the changing colors in the bottle of milk.
One possible question to be answered is, "How hot does a portion of the 
milk become and for how long?"

Exercise F1: Test the model against reality. An actual refrigerator
could be used with thermometers placed inside. The constants of 
proportionality could be adjusted in the model to fit reality. 
 
Exercise F2: Have the students do an experiment to determine how the 
temporary adjustment in the temperature of the milk affects the time taken 
for the milk to spoil. For example, comparisons could be made between how 
long the milk would take to sour without the hot pie being put in the 
refrigerator and how long with the hot pie being put in the refrigerator. 

Exercise F3: Have the students enlarge and shrink the pie. How is
the cooling visualization changed?

Exercise F4: Have the students put two pies in the refrigerator with
slightly different temperatures. How is the cooling visualization changed?

Exercise F5: Have the students change the range of colors displayed by
changing the palette. What palette is most effective in showing the
cooling of a pie?

The pattern above can be visualized using black for 0 and 1 for green. The 
visualization is much clearer when using colors. The transition rule is
that if a cell is dead (i.e., contains a zero) it becomes alive if it
has exactly three live neighbors. A live cell remains alive if it has
exactly two or three live neighbors.

Exercise G1:  Have the students work through the steps by hand for a glider 
gun to generate a glider.

Exercise G2: Have the students point the glider guns in different directions 
to see what happens.

First, the background of the screen representing a wall in a room
is set to a chosen color (i.e., the wall is "painted"). Two planes of 
256 rows by 256 columns of cells are used if running the program on a 
486 DX2 or faster processor. (If done by hand or on a slower computer 
the number of rows and columns should be scaled down to 16 rows by 16 
columns.) The rows and the columns are numbered from 0 to 255 starting 
with the upper left hand corner as in

	  0 1 2 ... 255
	0
	1
	2
	:
      255
	   
The initial configuration is for one plane to contain four ones in 
the middle. All other cells are set to zero. Each cell in the first plane
has four neighbors {N, E, S, and W}. The transition rule is for each cell to
count the ones in the neighbors. If the result is even, the cell is set 
to one; otherwise, the cell is set to zero. This process is repeated for 
each of the cells in the first plane. The second plane "trails" the
first plane. In other words, the second plane takes on the old values from
the first plane before the first plane changes to a new state. Four 
colors are used: a zero in a cell of both planes is black, a one in a cell
of the first plane and a zero in the corresponding cell of the second plane
is green, a zero and a one is blue, and two ones are red. 
   
Exercise H1: Have the students change the wall color and the color of
the tapestry in order to find a color coordinated match.

Exercise H2: Have the students compare the different tapestries
generated by starting with a 4 by 4 center, an 8 by 8 center,
a 16 by 16 center, and a 32 by 32 center.
